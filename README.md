# 2D QWOP-like
 An idea for a physics based platforming game

## Description
Inspired by the games by Bennete Foddy, I wanted to create a kind of game that was unique in the way that the player moved around. In this game, the player moves around by pointing a leg toward a surface, and propelling their foot into the surface to launch their body in the desired direction.
<br>

For now, there is no real goal in the game. It is just a proof of concept.

## Controls
**Pause:** Escape Key / Start button
<br>
**Left leg:**
<ul>
    <li>Direction: WASD / L Stick</li>
    <li>Extend foot: L Shift / L trigger</li>
</ul>

**Right leg:**
<ul>
    <li>Direction: IJKL / R Stick</li>
    <li>Extend foot: ; / R trigger</li>
</ul>

*Note: Using a keyboard seems to have issues when trying to move and extend at the same time.*
